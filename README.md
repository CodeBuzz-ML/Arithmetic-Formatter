# Arithmetic-Formatter
Hello, this is a simple python project in which the horizontal equation is arranged into vertical equation.

To start with, first, run the file with python 3.10 or 3.11.
Then, use the function "format(num1,num2,operation,ansOrNot)" (without the double quotes)

the num1 and num2 value should be an integer, while the operation value is an string, which accepts, "+", "-", "*", "/", "^" for addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and exponentation respectively.
the ansOrNot argument states whether the answer is to be calculated or not (in boolean form)...

That's it
Regards,
